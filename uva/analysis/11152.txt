Heron's Formula:
Let s = (a+b+c)/2. The area of the triangle, A, is sqrt(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)).

Circumradius:
The radius of the circumscribed (outside) circle is (a*b*c)/(4*A).

Inradius:
The radius of the inscribed (inside) circle is A / s.

From these, it should be pretty simple to find the areas of the three pieces.
